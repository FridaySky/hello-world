My username is based off my what-if names.
Dr. Friday was my OB/GYN who helped my mother give birth to me. My father forgot to ask for her permission to use her last name as my middle name.
Sky is one of the names my father considered giving me before changing his mind.
So, my real name could have been Sky Friday [myLastName].
